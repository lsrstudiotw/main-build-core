## Overview

**main-build-core** is a high-performance, fault-tolerant bi-directional emotional synchronization protocol, designed specifically for system architects and engineers operating in isolated environments (e.g., dark server rooms at 3 AM).

This module aims to solve the "Eternal Loneliness" problem commonly found in legacy human operating systems by establishing a persistent, encrypted connection between two compatible nodes.

Unlike previous unstable versions (see legacy branches: `ex-girlfriend-v2`, `situationship-beta`), this release is considered a **Stable Main Build** and is ready for production deployment.

## Features

* **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** By designating a partner as the "Master Branch," we eliminate redundant emotional data and version conflicts.
* **Automated Bug Rejection:** Proactive filtering of negative energy and redundant arguments before they reach the core logic processor.
* **Zero Downtime Deployment:** Hot-swappable affection modules ensure the relationship remains online even during maintenance windows (e.g., arguments about where to eat).
* **High Scalability:** Capable of handling infinite concurrent requests for attention (theoretical limit).

## Prerequisites

Before deploying this protocol, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

* **Hardware:** A functional human heart (v1.0 or later).
* **Software:** An open mind with legacy firewalls disabled.
* **I/O:** Working auditory sensors (ears) or compatible output devices (headphones).
* **Dependencies:** A basic understanding of tech-house rhythms and cyberpunk aesthetics.

## Installation

### Standard Deployment (Recommended)

We have simplified the deployment process into a single command. To install the full `love-package` and initialize the heartbeat monitor, please execute the following action:
